# Improvement Review Tracker

## Goal

Coordinate completion of the Image Tools improvement plan by sequencing the scoped task documents and centralising validation across the shared branch.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Read `docs/improvement-review.md` and all task documents in `docs/tasks/`.
- [ ] Ensure the branch `improvement-review-implementation` exists locally and on the remote if collaboration is needed.

## Implementation Checklist

1. [ ] Create (or verify) the working branch `improvement-review-implementation` from the latest `main` or agreed base; push it to the remote for shared access.
2. [ ] Have each task executed in an order that minimizes conflicts. If some can be run simultaneously because they they minimally intersect, group them:
   - Task 1
   - Task 2
   - Task 3
   - Task 4
3. [ ] After each task merges into `improvement-review-implementation`, re-run repository-wide checks and resolve conflicts before tackling the next task.
4. [ ] Maintain a running changelog summarising merged work inside `docs/improvement-review.md` or a dedicated section.
5. [ ] When all tasks are complete, prepare a final PR from `improvement-review-implementation` to the primary integration branch.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] `bun typecheck`
- [ ] `bun lint`
- [ ] `bun test` (if introduced by tasks)
- [ ] `bun build`
- [ ] Manual end-to-end smoke test via `vercel dev` covering token uploads, chain uploads, and OAuth login.
- [ ] Verify no outstanding TODOs or unchecked items remain in task documents.

## Completion Criteria

- All sub-task documents are marked complete with linked PRs merged into `improvement-review-implementation`.
- Repository builds, lints, and tests succeed on the integration branch.
- Final PR from `improvement-review-implementation` is ready with summary of improvements and validation evidence.

## Contributor Notes

- [ ] To fully complete the task you must make a commit to github branch `improvement-review-implementation`.
